This document forms the background for developping a sustainable business model for offering a subscription-based plant service of 100% native, wild-type flowers for Biel/Bienne.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
This repository is divided into four sections. 
* The first section provides a background on the precarious situation of biodiversity in general on this planet, and more specifically on vascular plants and insect life in Switzerland, and in the region around Biel/Bienne.  
* The second section summarizes the results of some 5000 plant observations made in the metropolitan area of Biel/Bienne from June - September 2020 and from February - September 2021, principally in the Biel/Bienne metropolitan area. 
* The third chapter presents a subscription model for selling native plants and explores some other relevat revenu streams. 
* The final chapter proposes some citizen science initiatives related to the preservation of biodiversity, and in particular genetic diversity directly related to this work.
