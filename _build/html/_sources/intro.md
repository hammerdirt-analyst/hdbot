Love plants is a model for offering a subscription-based plant service of 100% native, wild-type flowers that complements the biogeography of Biel/Bienne.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The first two chapters cover surveying the existing diversity of plantlife in the city of Biel/Bienne. Year One (2020) is focused on the path of the Suze river as it runs through the city, with some 850 plant observations. Year Two (2021) expands to include much of the city of Bienne with some 4500 plant observations so far. The 2021 survey period will end officially on October 15th, 2021.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The subsequent chapters are devoted to building sustainable business models based around wild-type flowers. The third chapter is devoted to the primary product, namely a subscription service for deliverty of buckets of in-season wildflowers. The fourth chapter is devoted to market context and identifying additional revenue streams related to the flower bucket service.
