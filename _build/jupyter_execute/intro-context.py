# ## A general decline
# 
# There is a global consensus that global biodiversity and ecosystem health are under serious threat. Rapid declines have been registered across nearly all major indices of ecoysystem health and biodiversity, with around 25% of species threatened with extinction across the Animal, Plant and Fungi Kingdom {cite}`ipbes_2019`. Data overwhelming points to long term and irreversible declines in biodiversity with the term sixth mass extinction being commonly evoked to describe the ongoing phenomenon {cite}`sixth_extinction`. The following quotation from a special issue of the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences dedicated to the decline in insects sums up the situation in stark terms`decline_anthroposcene`:
# 
# >Even without much-needed monitoring and demographic data, enough is already known, based on first principles and records for amphibians, birds, flowering plants, mammals, reptiles, insects, and other taxa, to understand that a biodiversity crisis is accelerating as the planetâ€™s human population grows, increasingly exacerbated by unprecedented recent climate changes and other anthropogenic stressors. Time is not on our side, and urgent action is needed on behalf of nature.

# The decline in insects is a trend particular concern linked to very specific changes in land use and agricultural practices. Europe is facing a serious biodiversity problem stemming from the loss of insects in the countryside. A 2017 study that identified a 75% decline between 1989 and 2017 in flying insect mass in nature reserves in Southern Germany prompted serious reflection among stakeholders and led to a popularization of the issue {cite}`insect_loss_DE`. Data from the UK and the Netherlands showed a decline of the same magnitude, both registered a drop of 50% since 1976 and and 1990 respectively, which itself comes after a drop in population on the order of 80% in the Netherlands in the period 1880 - 1940 {cite}`butterflies_europe`.

# ## Swiss Context Plants
# 
# More than a quarter of Swiss vascular plants are under threat with "thousands of local extinctions" of sensitive and endangered species.As the researchers who identified these local extinctions put it  (CITE):
# > Our study presents clear evidence that current efforts to conserve threatened plant species are insufficient to achieve national and international targets (Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), 2011; Swiss Biodiversity Strategy 2012) for maintaining biodiversity. The current paradigm of protecting and restoring threatened habitats is failing to avert extinctions. Going forward, we need to develop a comprehensive landscape approach, involving the creation of ecological infrastructure and translocation and assisted migration of threatened species into suitable habitats.
# 
# These localized extinctions are most prominent in Switzerland's Central Plateau region. This is partially due to the unique bio-geography of this region and partially due to the intense human pressures on the Central Plateau, home to most of Switzerland's agricultural output and where 70% of the population lives and works (CITE). 60% of the vascular plant species evaluated for the International Union of the Conservation of Nature's Redlist are classified as potentially or actually regionally threatened in the Central Plateau, followed by 50% of evaluated species for the Jura. As Biel lies on the border between two regions, the city has an opportunity and a responsibility to act.(REVIEW OF INFO FLORA IUCN REPORT ON VASCULAR PLANTS 2019 & 2020 PAPER)
# 
# The situation for insects and especially pollinators, often taken as key biological indicators, is extremely worrying. Of the 226 butterfly and moth species monitored nationally (out of some 3700 lepidotpera species confirmed in Switzerland), just over 50% are considered to be under threat or potentially under threat. Switzerland has not escaped the pan European decline in insect populations and diversity and researchers are clear that significant steps need to be taken immediately to reverse these trends. Most of this loss is occurring due to insecticides, ever increasing intensification of agriculture, and continued artificialisation of land for residential, agricultural or commercial purposes. (cite REVIEW OF SWISS ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORT ON INSECTS).

# While national actors work to set standards and engage in international negotiations to protect biodiversity and ecosystem health on a global scale, local public and private actors have significant room to maneuver. It is well known that one way to mitigate some of the anthropologic pressure is a judicious use of public spaces, such as road verges, railroad berms and parks, that balances their potential as habitats with the needs and requirements of the city's inhabitants. Allowing spaces to go un-mowed, sowing flower beds, and creating micro-habitats strategically throughout urban and suburban areas are small, relatively cost-neutral steps that can have marginal but important impacts. In fact, studies have shown that (sub)urban green spaces and road verges can provide plants, insects and birds with suitable conditions to pursue their life cycles and even become a "last refuge" for certain species.
# <p>&nbsp;</p>
# At the same time, it is important to consider the effectiveness of the actions being taken by local authorities. Annual flower meadows for pollinators are an increasingly common sight in different countries, yet provide only a fraction of the resources of perennial meadows, which themselves do not provide resources as continuously throughout the year as remnant weed populations. There are many factors to consider, and unraveling the complex web of ecosystem interdependence remains on the frontier of science. Beyond the ecological questions, there is also the question of genetic diversity. A significant part of biodiversity that had been overlooked until relatively recently, genetic diversity is required for the long term health and success of populations. This project will not address these questions directly, but will build the knowledge to begin addressing them during the second iteration.
