# The Biodiversity Box

# NOTE: The current repository for this project has been moved to https://github.com/thorerismann/flora-buckets. This repository will be left open during an interim period for backup, testing and reference purposes.


A Biodiversity Box is a mini biotope composed of 100% native flowers sourced regionally built to reflect the unique biogeography of Biel/Bienne.

This repository is to build the Jupyter Book page available through the following dedicated link: https://thorerismann.github.io/hdbot/ T

It is divided into the following sections:

Part 1 (intro-context.ipynb) provides a short introduction to the dire situation facing biodiversity globally, and also in the region around Biel/Bienne. 

Part 2 (surveys.ipynb) summarizes the results of nearly 5000 vascular plant observations made in Biel between 2020 and 2021.

Part 3 (flora-buckets.ipynb) presents the biodiversity boxes concept. 

Part 4 (germination.ipynb) presents an experiment on plat germination.

Resources and further development ideas are presented in science.ipynb and resources .ipynb.

This page is under development and the final version will be frozen around December 2021. It will thus likely have been updated since the last time you visited. A French and German translation will be available soon.
