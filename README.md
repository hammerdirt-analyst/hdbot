# love plants

Love plants is a model for offering a subscription-based plant service of 100% native, wild-type flowers that complements the biogeography of Biel/Bienne.

The purpose of this development repository is to build revenue streams that complement the existing biogeography of the city of Biel/Bienne. This repository is under development and will likely have been updated since the last time you visited. A French and German version of this site will be available in the next few months.

The first two chapters are concerned with surveying the existing diversity of plantlife in the city of Biel/Bienne. Year One (2020) is focused on the path of the Suze river as it runs through the city, with some 850 plant observations. Year Two (2021) expands to include much of the city of Bienne with some 4500 plant observations so far. The survey period will end officially on October 15th, 2021.

The subsequent chapters are devoted to building sustainable business models based around wild-type flowers. The third chapter is devoted to the primary product, namely a subscription service for deliverty of buckets of in-season wildflowers. The fourth chapter is devoted to market context and reviewing additional revenue streams. 

The data used consists of original plant survey data conducted in 2020 and 2021 throughout the city of Biel. The reference files originate from Infoflora, the organization mandated by the Swiss confederation to monitor the health of plant populations in Switzerland (www.infoflora.ch).
