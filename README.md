# love plants

Love plants is a model for offering a subscription-based plant service of 100% native, wild-type flowers that complements the biogeography of Biel/Bienne.

This repository is divided into four sections. The first section provides a background on the situation of vascular plants and insect life in Switzerland, and more particularly in the region around Biel/Bienne, based primarily on recent nationwide reports and datasets issued by the Swiss Academy of Sciences and InfoFlora.  The second section summarizes the results of some 5000 plant observations made from June - September 2020 and from February - September 2021, principally in the Biel/Bienne metropolitan area. The third chapter presents the love plants concept. The final chapter proposes some citizen science initiatives related to the preservation of biodiversity, and in particular genetic diversity. 

This page is under development and the final version will be frozen around December 2021. It will thus likely have been updated since the last time you visited. A French and German version of this site will be available soon. The dedicated link is the following: https://thorerismann.github.io/hdbot/
