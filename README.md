This repository is used to produce a short report on identifying wild flowers along the urban Suze river in 2020. The final report is available as a Jupyter notebook (final-report.pynb)

The reference data used in the analysis is included in the resources/preprocessed folder organized into .json dictionairies. The original files are freely available from Info Flora (www.infoflora.ch).

The survey and reference data is prepared for analysis in the preprocessing file, with the results stored in the preprocessed folder. These files are then used to generate the graphics and analysis in the final-report.pynb file.
