abstract = {Abstract Terrestrial arthropods comprise the most species-rich communities on Earth, and grassland flowers provide resources for hundreds of thousands of arthropod species. Diverse grassland ecosystems worldwide are threatened by various types of environmental change, which has led to decline in arthropod diversity. At the same time, monitoring grassland arthropod diversity is time-consuming and strictly dependent on declining taxonomic expertise. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of complex samples has demonstrated that information on species compositions can be efficiently and non-invasively obtained. Here, we test the potential of wild flowers as a novel source of arthropod eDNA. We performed eDNA metabarcoding of flowers from several different plant species using two sets of generic primers, targeting the mitochondrial genes 16S rRNA and COI. Our results show that terrestrial arthropod species leave traces of DNA on the flowers that they interact with. We obtained eDNA from at least 135 arthropod species in 67 families and 14 orders, together representing diverse ecological groups including pollinators, parasitoids, gall inducers, predators, and phytophagous species. Arthropod communities clustered together according to plant species. Our data also indicate that this experiment was not exhaustive, and that an even higher arthropod richness could be obtained using this eDNA approach. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain information on diverse communities of insects and other terrestrial arthropods from eDNA metabarcoding of wild flowers. This novel source of eDNA represents a vast potential for addressing fundamental research questions in ecology, obtaining data on cryptic and unknown species of plant-associated arthropods, as well as applied research on pest management or conservation of endangered species such as wild pollinators.},

While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.},

    abstract = {Despite increasing awareness of global biodiversity loss, we lack quantitative data on local extinctions for many species. This is especially true for rare species, which are typically assessed on the basis of expert judgment rather than data. Revisiting previously assessed populations enables estimation of local extinction rates and the identification of species characteristics and habitats with high local extinction risk. Between 2010 and 2016, in a nationwide revisitation study, 420 volunteer botanists revisited 8,024 populations of the 713 rarest and most threatened plant species in Switzerland recorded between 1960 and 2001. Of the revisited 8,024 populations, 27% had gone locally extinct. Among critically endangered species, the local extinctions increased to 40%. Species from ruderal and freshwater habitat types showed the highest proportion of local extinctions. Our results provide compelling evidence for rapid and widespread local extinctions and suggest that current conservation measures are insufficient. Local extinctions precede and provide early warnings for global extinctions. The ongoing loss of populations suggests that we will lose species diversity unless we scale up species-targeted conservation and restoration measures, especially in anthropogenic landscapes.},

abstract = {Urban areas are species-rich ecosystems. The question remains, however, whether urban species constitute a unique community, and thus add value to landscape biodiversity, or whether they are just a mixture of species from surrounding ecosystems. In this study, the occurrence and abundance of arthropods were analysed according to trophic guilds (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae as xylophagous species, Apiformes as pollinators, Neuroptera as flying predators, Araneae and Carabidae as surface-dwelling predators) in urban, agricultural and forest ecosystems in Switzerland. To assess the likely origin of arthropod fauna in Swiss cities, we identified character species (regular and constant occurrence) for ecosystems and performed ordination and cluster analyses. In total, we studied 10,034 specimens from 497 species and found that 13% of all species and 10% of the character species were predominately found in the urban ecosystems. Community analyses showed that the three ecosystems harbour distinct species assemblages. While communities at forest sites are quite dissimilar from those at urban and agricultural sites, these latter share more than one third of all character species, which indicates either that agricultural areas function as source habitats for urban communities or that agricultural species have survived urbanisation in situ. Overall, our study identified a distinct urban arthropod community that enriches landscape (gamma) diversity in Switzerland. Urban sites may provide novel habitats for species of former extensive agriculture, or species otherwise not, or scarcely, occurring in the region. The present study illuminates the value of urban arthropods for overall biodiversity which should be incorporated in planning decisions.}

abstract={Insects are key components of urban ecological networks and are greatly impacted by anthropogenic activities. Yet, few studies have examined how insect functional groups respond to changes to urban vegetation associated with different management actions. We investigated the response of herbivorous and predatory heteropteran bugs to differences in vegetation structure and diversity in golf courses, gardens and parks. We assessed how the species richness of these groups varied amongst green space types, and the effect of vegetation volume and plant diversity on trophic- and species-specific occupancy. We found that golf courses sustain higher species richness of herbivores and predators than parks and gardens. At the trophic- and species-specific levels, herbivores and predators show strong positive responses to vegetation volume. The effect of plant diversity, however, is distinctly species-specific, with species showing both positive and negative responses. Our findings further suggest that high occupancy of bugs is obtained in green spaces with specific combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. The challenge for managers is to boost green space conservation value through actions promoting synergistic combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. Tackling this conservation challenge could provide enormous benefits for other elements of urban ecological networks and people that live in cities.},

abstract={Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

Extinction rates have varied through time, with lower ‘background’ rates over most of the fossil record being punctuated by brief intervals of hugely elevated biodiversity loss caused by natural events including volcanism, anoxia, sea-level and climate change, and also by extraterrestrial impacts on at least one occasion.},

	abstract = {Major declines in insect biomass and diversity, reviewed here, have become obvious and well documented since the end of World War II. Here, we conclude that the spread and intensification of agriculture during the past half century is directly related to these losses. In addition, many areas, including tropical mountains, are suffering serious losses because of climate change as well. Crops currently occupy about 11\% of the world{\textquoteright}s land surface, with active grazing taking place over an additional 30\%. The industrialization of agriculture during the second half of the 20th century involved farming on greatly expanded scales, monoculturing, the application of increasing amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, and the elimination of interspersed hedgerows and other wildlife habitat fragments, all practices that are destructive to insect and other biodiversity in and near the fields. Some of the insects that we are destroying, including pollinators and predators of crop pests, are directly beneficial to the crops. In the tropics generally, natural vegetation is being destroyed rapidly and often replaced with export crops such as oil palm and soybeans. To mitigate the effects of the Sixth Mass Extinction event that we have caused and are experiencing now, the following will be necessary: a stable (and almost certainly lower) human population, sustainable levels of consumption, and social justice that empowers the less wealthy people and nations of the world, where the vast majority of us live, will be necessary.There are no data underlying this work.},

	abstract = {The ongoing sixth mass extinction may be the most serious environmental threat to the persistence of civilization, because it is irreversible. Thousands of populations of critically endangered vertebrate animal species have been lost in a century, indicating that the sixth mass extinction is human caused and accelerating. The acceleration of the extinction crisis is certain because of the still fast growth in human numbers and consumption rates. In addition, species are links in ecosystems, and, as they fall out, the species they interact with are likely to go also. In the regions where disappearing species are concentrated, regional biodiversity collapses are likely occurring. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking massive global actions to save humanity{\textquoteright}s crucial life-support systems.The ongoing sixth mass species extinction is the result of the destruction of component populations leading to eventual extirpation of entire species. Populations and species extinctions have severe implications for society through the degradation of ecosystem services. Here we assess the extinction crisis from a different perspective. We examine 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and determine which are on the brink of extinction because they have fewer than 1,000 individuals. There are 515 species on the brink (1.7\% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94\% of the populations of 77 mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear{\textemdash}extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking much-expanded worldwide actions to save wild species and humanity{\textquoteright}s crucial life-support systems from this existential threat.},

In the Netherlands, 20\% of species have become extinct, and since 1990 overall numbers in the country declined by 50\%. Distribution trends showed that butterfly distributions began decreasing long ago, and between 1890 and 1940, distributions declined by 80\%. In Flanders (Belgium), 20 butterflies have become extinct (29\%), and between 1992 and 2007 overall numbers declined by around 30\%. A European Grassland Butterfly Indicator from 16 European countries shows there has been a 39\% decline of grassland butterflies since 1990. The 2010 Red List of European butterflies listed 38 of the 482 European species (8\%) as threatened and 44 species (10\%) as near threatened (note that 47 species were not assessed). A country level analysis indicates that the average Red List rating is highest in central and mid-Western Europe and lowest in the far north of Europe and around the Mediterranean. The causes of the decline of butterflies are thought to be similar in most countries, mainly habitat loss and degradation and chemical pollution. Climate change is allowing many species to spread northward while bringing new threats to susceptible species.

    abstract = {Root hemiparasitic plants frequently establish haustorial connections simultaneously to several host species, which may differ in the quality of their contribution to the nutrition of the parasite and in their sensitivity to parasitic attack. The obligate hemiparasite Melampyrum arvense was grown with three host species (Lolium perenne, Medicago sativa and Linum usitatissimum) and with all possible binary host mixtures to test whether (1) a mixed host supply (e.g. a legume and a grass) results in an increase in heterotrophic benefit to the parasite and (2) whether the hemiparasite may influence the competitive balance between hosts. Growth of M. arvense was much stronger with the legume (M. sativa) as host than with the two non-leguminous species. The biomass of parasites grown with binary mixtures of the host species was not higher than that of parasites grown with the three host species separately. Thus, the results do not support the hypothesis that hemiparasites benefit from a mixed host supply. The rank order of species in terms of host quality (M. sativa > L. usitatissimum > L. perenne) was the same as that in terms of damage suffered from the hemiparasite. Host and parasite biomass in individual pots were also negatively correlated. In two of the binary mixtures of host species M. arvense influenced the competitive balance between hosts, because the hemiparasite reduced the growth of the legume M. sativa much more strongly than that of the other species. Overall productivity per pot (hosts + hemiparasite) was reduced by M. arvense, because parasite biomass did not fully compensate for the reduction in host biomass caused by parasitism.},

abstract = {Abstract The performance of root hemiparasites depends strongly on host species identity, but it remains unknown whether there exist general patterns in the quality of species as hosts for hemiparasites and in their sensitivity to parasitism. In a comparative approach, the model root hemiparasites Rhinanthus minor and R. alectorolophus were grown with 25 host species (grasses, forbs, and legumes) at two nutrient levels. Hosts grown without parasites served as a control. Host species identity strongly influenced parasite biomass and other traits, and both parasites grew better with legumes and grasses than with forbs. The biomass of R. alectorolophus was much higher than that of R. minor with all host plants and R. alectorolophus responded much more strongly to higher nutrient availability than R. minor. The performance of the two species of Rhinanthus with individual hosts was strongly correlated, and it was also correlated with that of R. alectorolophus and the related Odontites vulgaris in previous experiments with many of the same hosts, but only weakly with that of the less closely related Melampyrum arvense. The negative effect of R. minor on host biomass was less strong than that of R. alectorolophus, but stronger relative to its own biomass, suggesting that it is more parasitic. The impact of the two parasites on individual hosts did not depend on nutrient level and was correlated. Several legumes and grasses were tolerant of parasitism. While R. minor slightly reduced mean overall productivity, R. alectorolophus increased it with several species, indicating that the loss of host biomass was more than compensated by that of the parasite. The results show that closely related parasites have similar host requirements and correlated negative effects on individual hosts, but that there are also specific interactions between pairs of parasitic plants and their hosts.},

The root hemiparasite M. arvense was grown at different densities without a host and with Hordeum vulgare as host. Increased density had no effect on parasites without a host but significantly reduced the growth of parasites grown with a host. All M. arvense seedlings grown without a host died after a few weeks and attained a biomass only 60% higher than mean seed mass. In a second experiment M. arvense was grown with Medicago sativa. The shoots of parasites and hosts were separated in parts of the pots by an aluminium foil to exclude above-ground competition. In addition, the host plants were killed by cutting off their shoots after 4, 7, 10 and 16 weeks of growth. The continued availability of M. sativa as a host increased the biomass of M. arvense by more than two orders of magnitude. Across all treatments there was a strong allometric relationship between root mass and shoot mass of M. arvense, but root mass was much less stimulated by the host than shoot mass. The parasite, however, survived the killing of its host plants at all stages of development. Parasites, whose host had been killed, continued to grow for several weeks but their biomass was reduced in comparison to parasites grown with a living host. There was no significant effect of above-ground interactions on parasite biomass, but parasites grown unseparated from host shoots were taller. The negative effect of the hemiparasite M. arvense on its host M. sativa was much stronger than that of another host individual, and disproportionate to its size: 1mg of Melampyrum biomass caused a reduction in host biomass of 2.4mg. M. arvense also reduced the total productivity per pot, indicating a lower efficiency in resource utilization by the parasites. Root growth of parasitized M. sativa was more strongly reduced than shoot growth, resulting in a lower biomass allocation to roots.}

 abstract = {Root hemiparasites are green plants which attach to roots of other plants and extract solutes from the host-root xylem parasitically. They frequently act as keystone species by affecting competitive relations in plant communities and altering mineral nutrient cycling. Understanding their ecology has been hindered by the difficulty to identify host associations of hemiparasitic plants growing in natural conditions. Direct examination of host associations is only possible at sites with specific soil types (e.g. sandy substrates) that allow host roots to be traced to the shoot to identify the host species. We investigated the possibility of using a DNA barcodingbased approach to identify host associations of root hemiparasites growing naturally. Host associations of Melampyrum nemorosum, Rhinanthus major and Rhinanthus minor were investigated. Their root systems were washed free of soil to reveal haustorial connections. Host-root fragments were subjected to DNA extraction and the plastid DNA trnL intron was sequenced. The functioning of haustoria was examined in semi-thin anatomical sections. The analysis of the DNA of host roots yielded a ca 60% success rate. The Rhinanthus species were confirmed to attack mostly grasses and legumes. By contrast, Melampyrum nemorosum attached mainly to plants of Rosaceae and Asteraceae. In addition, both conspecific and heterospecific connections between the hemiparasites were frequently observed. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of the DNA barcoding approach for identifying host associations of root hemiparasites at sites where tracing host roots to their shoot is not possible due to soil structure or high rooting density.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Seed mixtures of wildflowers are used increasingly in schemes to restore biodiversity in intensively managed farmland. Usually, the seed mixtures are produced by commercial suppliers and they may be distributed over large geographical distances. It is therefore important to ask what problems may arise from using seed that is not of local origin. The aim of this study was to evaluate one potential problem, namely the effects of genetic introgression of foreign provenances on the fitness of local weed populations. 2. The problem was investigated using the arable weed species Agrostemma githago, Papaver rhoeas and Silene alba, all of which are commonly included in commercial seed mixtures in Switzerland. Hybrids (F1 and F2 backcrosses) were made between local Swiss plants and plants of English, German and Hungarian provenance (plus F1 from one US source in Silene). In a field experiment the growth of the hybrid plants was compared with that of the parents. Above-ground dry matter after one growing season was taken as a measure of fitness. Additionally, survivorship and seed mass were determined for some of the hybrids. 3. The biomass data revealed negative outbreeding effects caused by epistasis in all four F2 backcrosses of Papaver and in the F2 of Agrostemma hybridized with plants of German provenance; no such effects were found in Silene. Survival was slightly lower in the F1 hybrids of Papaver, and considerably reduced in the F2 backcrosses. For Silene, a heterosis effect was evident in seed mass in the F1 generation, while seed mass decreased in the F2. The same trend, although less strong, was also observed in Agrostemma. 4. The results suggest that only plants of relatively local origin should be used in wildflower mixtures, although it is not possible to specify precisely over what distance seed can safely be transferred. The same recommendation is also valid for schemes to reinvigorate endangered plant populations. The relevance of the fitness components that were measured, and the long-term effects of genetic introgressions, are discussed.},
