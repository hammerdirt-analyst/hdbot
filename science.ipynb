    "In order to germinate the wildflower seeds representative of the Felseck biotope a number of different factors must be accounted for. Seeds have been divided into those that are easy to germinate and those that are difficult. For easy to germinate seeds, they will follow a standard planting protocol, those that are difficult will be tested in a number of different combinations of light, alternating temperature, and cold stratification.\n",
